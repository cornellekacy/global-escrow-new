                    <p>As a broker we have utilized multiple forms of seller financing in the past, including Bond for Deed contracts. We have found Global Escrow, Inc., not only very knowledgeable when it comes to preparing Bond for Deed contracts, but very beneficial in helping buyers and sellers understand the ins and outs of the contract into which they are entering.</p>

                    <p>I have been involved with Bond for Deed contracts since the 90Ã­s and found the years, Escrow Services has been a pleasing experience for both the buyers and sellers. If you are closing a sale I would recommend giving them a call for fast efficient results!"</p>

                    <p>I am writing to thank you and compliment you on your professional staff and attention to customer service. As the deadline approached on filing my amended tax return and claim for the First Time Home Buyer Credit I contacted your office on Saturday of a 3 day holiday weekend to request additional documentation needed by the IRS that was due to them by Tuesday</p>

                    <p>I wanted to help my daughter purchase her first home by lending her the money and taking a mortgage on the house. I also wanted my daughter to be responsible to someone other than Dad for payments, handling insurance and tax escrows, etc. I have used Escrow Services to fill this role for the past three years.</p>

                    <p>I have had principals from Escrow Services come to our meetings and speak to our agents about the advantages of Bond for Deed transactions in this difficult market. My experience is that they have explained and educated the Bond for Deed process to the agents in the same fashion as they do with their company's clients.</p>
